With JUVO Mail Editor you can edit emails triggered by WordPress using the Gutenberg Editor. By using placeholders, the emails become highly dynamic.

Simply create a mailing and connect it to the desired trigger. Triggers are either predefined or can be defined by plugin authors.

For more information about placeholders, triggers and extensibility of the plugin check out the GitHub Wiki.
